## About Me
I am a sophomore at Lehigh University studying Political Science and Journalism. I've lived in Larchmont, NY my entire life, but have loved exploring the ins and outs of Lehigh's campus. Please feel free to connect with me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmadillon98/) page.

While I was watching the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, I wondered to myself the role music plays in people's lives. Below is an infographic which demonstrates the trends in music between 2017 and 2016.
